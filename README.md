**Exercise 1 (Easy):**

**Overview:**
You are a software developer at a school. Your task is to create a program that asks the user for the number of students in a class and their respective scores. The program should then calculate the average score of the class. In this exercise, you will practice using the Scanner class, for loop, and break statement in Java.

**Examples:**
```
Input: Number of students: 3, Scores: 85, 90, 95
Output:   Average score: 90
```

**Step Guidance:**
1. Use the Scanner class to get the number of students and their respective scores.
2. Use a for loop to sum up all the scores. If a score entered is negative, use a break statement to exit the loop as it is invalid.
3. Divide the total score by the number of students to get the average.
4. Print out the average score of the class.

**Notes:**
Remember to handle the case where the user enters a negative score.

**Bonus:**
Add functionality to also calculate the median and mode of the scores.

**Exercise 2 (Medium):**

**Overview:**
You are a software developer at a grocery store. Your task is to create a program that prints out all the items in the inventory. In this exercise, you will practice using arrays and the forEach loop in Java.

**Examples:**
```
Input: Inventory: ["Apples", "Bananas", "Oranges"]
Output:   Apples, Bananas, Oranges
```

**Step Guidance:**
1. Create an array of Strings to represent the inventory.
2. Use a forEach loop to print out each item in the inventory.

**Notes:**
Remember to handle the case where the inventory is empty.

**Bonus:**
Add functionality to sort the inventory alphabetically before printing.

**Exercise 3 (Medium):**

**Overview:**
You are a software developer at a bank. Your task is to create a program that calculates the compound interest over a certain period. In this exercise, you will practice using the Scanner class, for loop, and continue statement in Java.

**Examples:**
```
Input: Principal: 1000, Interest rate: 5%, Years: 5
Output:   Total amount: 1276.28
```

**Step Guidance:**
1. Use the Scanner class to get the principal amount, the rate of interest, and the number of years.
2. Use a for loop to calculate the compound interest for each year. If the interest rate entered is negative, use a continue statement to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
3. Print out the total amount after the specified number of years.

**Notes:**
Remember to handle the case where the user enters a negative interest rate.

**Bonus:**
Add functionality to also calculate the simple interest.

**Exercise 4 (Hard):**

**Overview:**
You are a software developer at a game company. Your task is to create a program that simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. In this exercise, you will practice using 2D arrays, nested for loops, and break statement in Java.

**Examples:**
```
Input: Board: [["X", "O", "X"], ["O", "X", "O"], ["X", "O", "X"]]
Output:   Winner: X
```

**Step Guidance:**
1. Create a 2D array to represent the game board.
2. Use nested for loops to check for a win condition after each move. If a win condition is met, use a break statement to exit the loop.
3. Print out the winner of the game.

**Notes:**
Remember to handle the case where the game is a draw.

**Bonus:**
Add functionality to also simulate a game of Connect Four.

**Exercise 5 (Hard):**

**Overview:**
You are a software developer at a weather station. Your task is to create a program that finds the highest temperature in a week. In this exercise, you will practice using the Scanner class, for loop, and continue statement in Java.

**Examples:**
```
Input: Temperatures: [-5, 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
Output:   Highest temperature: 25
```

**Step Guidance:**
1. Use the Scanner class to get the temperatures for each day of the week.
2. Use a for loop to find the highest temperature. If the temperature entered is below absolute zero (-273.15Â°C), use a continue statement to skip the current iteration and move to the next one.
3. Print out the highest temperature of the week.

**Notes:**
Remember to handle the case where the user enters a temperature below absolute zero.

**Bonus:**
Add functionality to also find the lowest temperature of the week.
